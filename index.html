	        <p>A <span class="tangerine">decompression</span> party, decom or decomp is a gathering that brings people, Burners and Burner-curious, together to decompress the weight of the everyday life. The gathering is an easy portal for newcomers to step into the culture. Decompression is about co-creation, community and people - it brings together art, performances, workshops and music.</p>

	        <p>Helsinki Decompression will be the first official Burning Man event in Finland. We, <span class="tangerineHover">you and me</span>, will create an immersive space where art and music becomes tangible. We believe that traditional consumer-producer events are boring, thus this event will not be boring. Together we will co-create this party to re-create the everyday reality with a more interesting one.</p>

                <h2>The Ten Principles</h2>
                <p>Burning Man has established ten guidelines over which it has built the Burning Man culture. They were crafted not as a dictate of how people should be and act, but as a reflection of the community’s ethos and culture as it had organically developed since the event’s inception. Helsinki Decompression will be built over these fundamental principles.</p>

    			<h2>FAQ</h2>
    			<h4>What will I get for the ticket?</h4>
				<p>Access to a big playground. The house provides water, toilets, power, security. The program is made by visitors. Everything else, including, but not limited to, food, extension chords, sound system, shelter, candy, art, hugs, clothing, music, dreams, fire safety, common sense, cleaning, loving and dancing will be up to the participants of the Decompression to provide.</p>

				<h4>How much do I have to work?</h4>
				<p>So, what does it mean to "participate", to contribute? Well, only you can be the judge of your own self-expression. Whether you build giant contraptions, play music, make smoothies or give excellent massages, you do it on your own conditions. It is up to you to find a way of contributing that you are comfortable with. Along your way, you will find many who are willing to help you, and many who will be needing help. Participation is not about performance, it's a way of looking at the world around you as an opportunity to give.</p>

				<h4>Can I play music/DJ at the Decompression?</h4>
				<p>Yes. All the program will go through participation form, including DJ/artist perfomances. Fill the form and we will contact you if you get selected.</p>

				<h4>How about alcohol?</h4>
				<p>Due to Finnish laws, the only alcohol allowed will be sold by the venue. The bar will be open 18.00-03.00 on Saturday night. Do not bring your own alcohol to the event.</p>

				<h4>Can I bring my kids to the Decompression?</h4>
				<p>Children and teenagers under the age of 18 can come to the event when there is no alcohol being sold. This means you can bring them during the day time. Children enter free of charge if accompanied by a parent or caretaker.</p>

				<h4>Who cleans up? What is this “Leave no Trace”-thing?</h4>
				<p>Leaving No Trace means being mindful of the trash - or "Matter Out Of Place" (MOOP) - we create around us. Think of this as being your best friend's house party. If you realize you have trash in your hand, put it in a trash can instead of leaving it on a table. If you have a bottle, recycle it immediately when it gets empty, instead of postponing it until another time.</p>

				<!-- The Sunday, March 13, is dedicated to dismounting and removing any projects built during the week and weekend. You are responsible for removing anything that you brought to the location. Some recycling will be provided, but if you bring bigger stuff, you need to have a way to get it back out. -->
<!-- 
				<h4>How do I bring stuff to the Decompression?</h4>
				<p>You can drive straight into the venue at all times except 20.00-03.00 on Friday and Saturday night (then you have to unload on the parking lot next to the venue). If you need help with transport, please ask around in #logistics on Slack.</p>

				<h4>Will there be a place to check in clothing or valuables?</h4>
				<p>There will be a free coat check / storage.</p>

				<h4>Will there be tickets sold at the door?</h4>
				<p>We won't promise anything. </p>

				<h4>I'm a member of the media, how do I get accreditation?</h4>
				<p>We treat everyone the same, and do not give out media passes. You are more than welcome to join us as a co-creator, by buying a ticket and participate fully in co-creating the event! For other media inquiries, please contact Gustaf Josefsson, 0709-854979.</p>
