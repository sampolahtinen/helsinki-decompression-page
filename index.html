	        <p>A <span class="tangerine">decompression</span> party, decom or decomp is a gathering that brings people together to decompress the weight of the everyday life. The gathering is an easy portal for newcomers to step into the Burning Man culture. Decompression is about co-creation, community and people - it brings together art, performances, workshops and music.</p>

	        <p>Helsinki Decompression will be the first official <a class="regionals" target="_blank" href="http://regionals.burningman.org/">regional</a> Burning Man event in Finland. We, <span class="tangerineHover">you and I</span>, will create an immersive space where art and music becomes tangible. We believe that traditional consumer-producer events are boring, thus this event will not be boring. Together we will co-create this party to re-create the everyday reality with a more interesting one.</p>

                    We encourage you all to contribute in your own way to this magnificent experience.

		  <h3>Mönttilaiva</h3>
		  <p>
		  	Mönttilaiva Installation is a dreamland which invites the guest to dive into a play with humming lump-sculptures and mellow medusas. The installation leaves space to the viewer’s imagination and own thoughts with its light minimalism.
		  </p>

		  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width5">
		  <h3>Recover Laboratory</h3>
		  <p>Recover Laboratory is a site-specific contemporary artwork. We build experiential labyrinths and performances in weird and ordinary places transferring them to another worlds.

			Recover Laboratory - Love Edition is a true bundle of joy. It is the embodiment of love and safety. A state that we can no longer get back to in reality. Love edition is a re-make of an other world on this earth that is purely safe, where no thought of worry exists (were thoughts might even not exist), a place for the happily ignorant with true presence, a place for growth and restoration. The human womb. 

			We are born from the act of love or lust (or both), floating for months on end in a warm quiet sanctum, growing and prospering. After our conscious minds and material bodies become too big for our little home, we adventure into the world. As the cold hard world takes us into its hands and moulds us into unrecognisable shapes, we might be left licking our wounds. It’s time to be re-born. The recover Love edition will take you into its warm loving shelter, where you can take a minute to rebuild yourself and when you are ready, exit into the world again, a-new, recovered and stronger.</p>

		  <h3>Glitter Mama's Face Paint Corner</h3>
		  <p>I have some experience from painting faces and glittering people up at festivals, and I would love to bring a bit of that magic to Helsinki Decompression. You can see some of my work at Instagram (@enkelikala), although they are mostly a bit more intricate works that take several hours.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="grid-item grid-item--width2">
		  <h3>Trash Music</h3>
		  <p>The workshop explores the sounds of different used, recycled or found objects and materials. During the workshop participants will build an interactive sound installation using sequencer controlled motors and solenoids to create acoustic sounds from different found and recycled materials.
			The end result can be an installation that other visitors can play and interact with when passing by.

		  <h3>Tea House Kolmikonna</h3>
		  <p>Tea House Kolmikonna will be a Chinese-style tea table with kung fu tea equipment. The term kung fu tea literally means "making tea with skill". The strong high quality tea from the mountains of Yunnan province delivers a stimulating kick to all participants, while relaxing at the same time. The table seats around six partygoers at a time. </p>

		  <h3>Making You Wonder Again</h3>
		  <p>So the idea is to collect all the little puzzle pieces that astonish people, whether it is something in nature, in science, in communities, in spiritual, cultural or banal areas of life. Ranging from the existence of rainbows, the beauty of a dead leaf, the development of AI, the transcendent effects of psychedelics, the growth of a child, ... Well and whatever any one comes up with.</p>

                <h2>The Ten Principles</h2>
                <p>Burning Man has established ten guidelines over which it has built the Burning Man culture. They were crafted not as a dictate of how people should be and act, but as a reflection of the community’s ethos and culture as it had organically developed since the event’s inception. Helsinki Decompression will be built over these fundamental principles.</p>

    			<h2>FAQ</h2>
    			<h4>What will I get for the ticket?</h4>
				<p>Access to a big playground. The house provides water, toilets, power, security. The program is made by visitors. Everything else, including, but not limited to, food, extension chords, sound system, shelter, candy, art, hugs, clothing, music, dreams, fire safety, common sense, cleaning, loving and dancing will be up to the participants of the Decompression to provide.</p>

				<h4>How much do I have to work?</h4>
				<p>So, what does it mean to "participate", to contribute? Well, only you can be the judge of your own self-expression. Whether you build giant contraptions, play music, make smoothies or give excellent massages, you do it on your own conditions. It is up to you to find a way of contributing that you are comfortable with. Along your way, you will find many who are willing to help you, and many who will be needing help. Participation is not about performance, it's a way of looking at the world around you as an opportunity to give.</p>

				<h4>Can I play music/DJ at the Decompression?</h4>
				<p>Yes. All the program will go through participation form, including DJ/artist perfomances. Fill the form and we will contact you if you get selected.</p>

				<h4>How about alcohol?</h4>
				<p>Due to Finnish laws, the only alcohol allowed will be sold by the venue. The bar will be open 18.00-03.00 on Saturday night. Do not bring your own alcohol to the event.</p>

				<h4>Can I bring my kids to the Decompression?</h4>
				<p>Children and teenagers under the age of 18 can come to the event when there is no alcohol being sold. This means you can bring them during the day time. Children enter free of charge if accompanied by a parent or caretaker.</p>

				<h4>Who cleans up? What is this “Leave no Trace”-thing?</h4>
				<p>Leaving No Trace means being mindful of the trash - or "Matter Out Of Place" (MOOP) - we create around us. Think of this as being your best friend's house party. If you realize you have trash in your hand, put it in a trash can instead of leaving it on a table. If you have a bottle, recycle it immediately when it gets empty, instead of postponing it until another time.</p>

				<!-- The Sunday, March 13, is dedicated to dismounting and removing any projects built during the week and weekend. You are responsible for removing anything that you brought to the location. Some recycling will be provided, but if you bring bigger stuff, you need to have a way to get it back out. -->
<!-- 
				<h4>How do I bring stuff to the Decompression?</h4>
				<p>You can drive straight into the venue at all times except 20.00-03.00 on Friday and Saturday night (then you have to unload on the parking lot next to the venue). If you need help with transport, please ask around in #logistics on Slack.</p>

				<h4>Will there be a place to check in clothing or valuables?</h4>
				<p>There will be a free coat check / storage.</p>

				<h4>Will there be tickets sold at the door?</h4>
				<p>We won't promise anything. </p>

				<h4>I'm a member of the media, how do I get accreditation?</h4>
				<p>We treat everyone the same, and do not give out media passes. You are more than welcome to join us as a co-creator, by buying a ticket and participate fully in co-creating the event! For other media inquiries, please contact Gustaf Josefsson, 0709-854979.</p>
