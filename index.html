	        <p>A <span class="tangerine">decompression</span> party, decom or decomp is a local reunion for Burning Man participants to help ease themselves back into everyday society after the "big event".

	        <p>Helsinki Decompression will be the first official Burning Man event in Finland. We, <span class="tangerineHover">you and me</span>, will create an immersive space where art and music becomes tangible. We believe that traditonal consumer-producer events are boring, thus this event will not be boring.

                <h2>The Ten Principles</h2>
                <p>Burning Man has established ten guidelines over which it has built the Burning Man culture. They were crafted not as a dictate of how people should be and act, but as a reflection of the community’s ethos and culture as it had organically developed since the event’s inception. Helsinki Decompression will be built over these fundamental principles.</p>
